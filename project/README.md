# Project Documentation

This folder contains project documentation that is not tracked by Git. You can safely store here:

- Design documents
- Meeting notes
- Planning materials
- Technical specifications
- Work in progress documents
- Personal notes and drafts

Note: This folder is ignored by Git (listed in .gitignore) to keep the repository clean and allow for personal/team documentation without version control.
